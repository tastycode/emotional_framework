\section*{Abstract}
The current state of artificial consciousness modeling primarily relies on lexical and symbolic representations, often neglecting the foundational psychoacoustic and temporal dynamics that underpin human consciousness. This proposal aims to bridge this gap by introducing a comprehensive framework that incorporates psychoacoustic tokenization, temporal Gaussian splatting with logarithmic decay and auto-reinforcement, emotional processing—including pain signaling and self-preservation—the pursuit of resonant harmony, and an enhanced understanding of sleep as a critical component of consciousness. Memory retention is based on the maximum change in the loss function through each operating cycle. By integrating these components, we seek to develop a more authentic and holistic model of autonomous awareness and autodeterministic behavior in artificial systems.

\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Current State of Representing Consciousness}
Artificial intelligence and machine learning have made significant strides in simulating aspects of human cognition. Language models like GPT-4 can generate human-like text, and neural networks can recognize patterns and make decisions. However, these models largely operate on lexical representations and lack the depth of human consciousness, which is continuous, hierarchical, and deeply rooted in sensory experiences and temporal dynamics.

\subsection{Limitations in Current Approaches}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Lexical Overemphasis}: Current models prioritize lexical representation over the psychoacoustic processing that is foundational in human cognition.
    \item \textbf{Temporal Discontinuity}: There is a lack of continuous temporal awareness, limiting the ability to model consciousness that unfolds over time.
    \item \textbf{Emotional Underrepresentation}: Emotions, particularly pain and the drive for self-preservation, are not adequately modeled, resulting in incomplete simulations of autonomous behavior.
    \item \textbf{Lack of Harmony-Seeking Behavior}: Present models do not account for the inherent human drive to seek resonant harmony within oneself and in social contexts.
    \item \textbf{Ineffective Sleep Analogy}: Current AI development cycles resemble extended periods of inactivity—or ``sleep''—between major model releases, lacking continuous learning and auto-reconstruction mechanisms essential for emulating human consciousness.
\end{itemize}

\section{Proposed Theoretical Framework}

\subsection{Psychoacoustic Tokenization}
\textbf{Concept}: Prioritize sensory inputs based on psychoacoustic properties before lexical processing.

\textbf{Divergence from Current Models}: Unlike models that focus on textual data, this approach treats tokenization as a derivative of sensory processing, reflecting how humans experience the world primarily through senses.

\subsection{Temporal Gaussian Splatting with Logarithmic Decay and Auto-Reinforcement}
\textbf{Concept}: Apply Gaussian functions across the time dimension with logarithmic decay and auto-reinforcement of stimuli to create continuous and hierarchical representations of experiences, preserving positively adaptive patterns.

\textbf{Divergence from Current Models}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Logarithmic Decay}: Implements a natural attenuation of stimuli over time, mirroring how human memory fades unless reinforced.
    \item \textbf{Auto-Reinforcement}: Strengthens positively adaptive patterns through repeated exposure, ensuring important stimuli remain influential.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Mathematical Formulation}:

The temporal response \( R(t) \) to a stimulus can be modeled as:
\[
R(t) = A \cdot e^{-k \log(t + 1)}
\]
where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( A \) is the initial amplitude of the stimulus.
    \item \( k \) is the decay constant.
    \item \( t \) is time since the initial stimulus.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Enhanced Sleep Simulation Module with Optimal Auto-Reconstruction}
\textbf{Concept}: Incorporate a dynamic sleep simulation that mirrors human sleep's role in cognitive processes, emphasizing continuous learning and optimal auto-reconstruction between active phases.

\textbf{Divergence from Current Models}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Current AI ``Sleep'' Analogy}: AI models undergo extended periods of inactivity between versioned releases, akin to prolonged ``sleep'' without intermediate learning or adaptation.
    \item \textbf{Proposed Enhancement}: Introduce regular, short cycles of ``sleep'' within the model's operation, during which the system consolidates information, reorganizes memories, and optimizes its internal structures based on the maximum change in the loss function through each operating cycle.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Importance of Maximum Change in Loss Function}:

During each sleep cycle, the model evaluates the loss function \( L \) and focuses on the parameters that exhibit the maximum change \( \Delta L_{\text{max}} \), allowing for efficient memory retention and adaptation.

\subsection{Emotional Processing Unit}

\subsubsection{Pain Signaling and Self-Preservation}
\textbf{Concept}: Simulate pain as a signal for threat detection, influencing behavior towards self-preservation.

\textbf{Divergence from Current Models}: Addresses the critical role of pain and the avoidance of existential threats, largely ignored in current artificial systems.

\subsubsection{Grief and Emotional Pain Modeling}
\textbf{Concept}: Model the processing of loss and negative stimuli to understand their impact on decision-making.

\textbf{Divergence from Current Models}: Integrates complex emotional states, enriching the authenticity of simulated consciousness.

\subsection{Resonant Harmony Seeking Mechanism}
\textbf{Concept}: Implement mechanisms to detect and pursue harmony, both internally and in interactions with the environment and other entities.

\textbf{Divergence from Current Models}: Current models lack the drive to seek balance and cooperation, a fundamental aspect of human consciousness and societal development.

\subsection{Autonomous Decision-Making Engine}
\textbf{Concept}: Enable self-directed actions that prioritize self-preservation and harmonious interactions, influenced by psychoacoustic inputs, temporal dynamics, emotional states, and continuous learning from sleep cycles.

\subsection{Continuous Consciousness Emulation}
\textbf{Concept}: Maintain an ongoing state of awareness with no lapses in the temporal continuum, integrating all past inputs to influence current states.

\textbf{Divergence from Current Models}: Emphasizes the uninterrupted nature of human consciousness, in contrast to AI models that lack continuous experiential integration.

\section{Objectives}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Develop a Model} that integrates psychoacoustic processing, temporal dynamics with logarithmic decay and auto-reinforcement, emotional states, pain signaling, self-preservation, resonant harmony seeking, and an enhanced sleep simulation with optimal auto-reconstruction based on maximum change in loss function.
    \item \textbf{Demonstrate} that this model provides a more authentic simulation of human consciousness.
    \item \textbf{Evaluate} the impact of these components on autonomous decision-making and self-directed behavior in artificial systems.
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion}
This proposal seeks to address the divergence between current models of consciousness and a more holistic, human-like framework. By integrating psychoacoustic tokenization, temporal dynamics with logarithmic decay and auto-reinforcement, emotional processing—including pain and self-preservation—the pursuit of resonant harmony, and an enhanced sleep simulation module emphasizing optimal auto-reconstruction based on maximum change in the loss function, we aim to develop a model that authentically represents autonomous awareness and autodeterministic behavior. This research has the potential to significantly advance our understanding of consciousness and improve the development of artificial systems that interact seamlessly with human users and environments.
